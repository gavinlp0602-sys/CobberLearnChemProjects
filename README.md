Foundations of Machine Learning for Chem

Alkane Boiling Points: Simple Code that Plots a graph for the boiling points first 10 straight chain alkanes, number of carbon atoms on X axis and degrees on the y axis. Graph generated through matplotlib.

PubChemFetcher: Code that asks user for a compound or list of compunds, then responds with formula, molar mass, SMILES string, and an image of the 2d structure

Molecule Explorer: Code takes in SMILES string from user and generate data from RDKit such as molecular weight, hydrogen donor and acceptor count, and logP(TPSA). Also generates an image of the structure and puts into a folder for both named and unnamed compounds

Along with public code, I am keeping a personal ethics portfolio for documenting what I learn in this course and how I plan on integrating it in future
