Foundations of Machine Learning for Chem

Alkane Boiling Points: Simple Code that Plots a graph for the boiling points first 10 straight chain alkanes, number of carbon atoms on X axis and degrees on the y axis. Graph generated through matplotlib.

PubChemFetcher: Code that asks user for a compound or list of compunds, then responds with formula, molar mass, smiles string, and an image of the 2d structure

Along with public code, I am keeping a personal ethics portfolio for documenting what I learn in this course and how I plan on integrating it in future
